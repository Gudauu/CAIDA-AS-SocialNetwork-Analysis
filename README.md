# CAIDA AS-SocialNetwork-Analysis

### Overview
This repository hosts the graduate thesis project for my bachelor's degree at _Fudan University_, Shanghai. The project focuses on analyzing the **CAIDA AS Relationships Dataset** spanning from 1998 to 2023.

### Dataset
The primary dataset used in this project is the [CAIDA AS Relationships Dataset](https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-relationships/). This extensive dataset provides valuable insights into the relationships among Autonomous Systems (ASes) on the internet.

### Motivation  
I embarked on this project during my tenure as a research assistant at the _Mobile System and Networking Lab_, which is now known as the _Big Data and Networking Group_. My work was conducted under the guidance of [Professor Yang, Chen](https://github.com/chenyang03). The project aligns with the lab's focus on networking and social networking analysis.

### Key Objectives  
Apply principles from social network analysis to understand how ASes interact in the digital realm.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Bash Scripts:** Utilized for data pre-processing to ensure data quality and consistency.
- **Python:** Applied for numerical analysis and generating valuable insights from the dataset.
- **R and Matplotlib:** Employed for data visualization to create informative and visually appealing graphics that convey findings effectively.

### Project Status
The main phase of this project has concluded, I am no longer actively working on it. However, feel free to explore the codebase, datasets, and research findings provided in this repository.
